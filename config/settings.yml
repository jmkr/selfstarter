# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - dollar amount
# NOTE: if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)
project_goal: 1000

# If you want to edit the FAQ, head over to app/views/orders/homepage/_faqs.html.erb

# This'll be both the page title (<title></title>) and the name in the header
product_name: "CraftCrate"

# This will be used in sentences like Hooray You've just reserved product_description
product_description: "your first CraftCrate"

# An image showcasing your product -- it'll show up when you pin your product
# It should be in app/assets/images
product_image_path: "my-product-image.png"

# The message on the orders page, Lockitron's is ""
value_proposition: "Once a month mystery crafting"

# YouTube or Vimeo Video URL (The embed URL, without the query string options)
# Replace /embed/ in your video url path with /v/ for video playback to work.
video_embed_url: "http://www.youtube.com/v/x_maXaIt2dE"

# If set to true, then the image at "/assets/video_placeholder.png" will be shown in place of the youtube
# video.  When the user clicks it, the vid will replace the image and start playing.
#
# NOTE: you can set this to false, and no image will be use - first frame of the video will be displayed
#
# NOTE: this only works for youtube video at the moment.  If its not for youtube, then just leave this property blank
use_video_placeholder: true

price:  29

# if use_payment_options is set to true, then a set of radio buttons will be displayed with various payment options.

# The paragraph below the price. You'd probably say something about how you're not going to charge them before it ships (so it's less risky).

# Social Stuff
facebook_app_id: "1234567890"

# If you want to change the images for the key points (e.g. "Kickstarter is not a store")
# They're in app/assets/images/#{pointer_number}-background.png
# So, the first key point, it's at app/assets/images/1-background.png
# Alternatively, change it up in app/assets/stylesheets/homepage/key_points.css.scss
