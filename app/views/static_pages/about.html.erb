		How It Started
		<ul>
			<br />
			<li>
				<p>
					After countless friends, family members, and sometimes strangers asked Taylor “where’d ya get that?” and the answer was always “I made it!”, she decided to share her DIYs and love for crafting with a larger audience. John provided the perfect support—with both technology and friendly encouragement—to make Craft Crate come to fruition.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, Craft Crate comes to you from Los Angeles, California where John and Taylor spend sunny days browsing supply warehouses and brainstorming new craft ideas over Urth Café’s French Press coffees.

He is a handsome tech nerd with an inherent eye for design and aesthetics. You can often find him listening to Neil Young, drinking coffee, and nerding out on his MacBook.
